00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Pack YOUR SWINSUITS I rented AN ENTIRE PRIVATE ISLAND FOR THE WEEKEND.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
IT'S TIME FOR A BEACH EPISODE.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Finally mortals! It's time for it.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
Finally! After all of Chaos, we could get some break.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
Yeah, we really need the break. Especially with that sleepover that happened a week ago.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
We don't talk about that. Please keep it secret, right? Fahad

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
I'm talking about it. Please do not pronounce my name like that
00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
But either way, I am actually excited for this.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Alright guys, let's go!

00:34.000 --> 00:41.000
alright uh thank you thank you really much because i couldnt drive because i am a minor you know

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Oh, I'm so excited, you know what I mean?

01:01.000 --> 01:09.000
Anyways, aight, come on everybody, pack your bags, pack your stuff, you'll have time to have fun this session!

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Ahhh!

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
The weather is very warm, is this tea?

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Is very nice and good.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
Anyways, I've heard about the volleyball ball showdown tournament team.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Well, I will join...

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
Okay, I can wait for this volleyball showdown tournament team, so I got thinky.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
Anyways, let me check who is my team.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Yeah, we're cooked.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
But anyways, it doesn't really matter for me, as long as we can possibly win.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
Anyways, let's see who is our current opponent for first round.

01:53.000 --> 02:06.000
So, team, we win in guys, like I just hope we're winning.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Right, Vegeta?

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
We are not winning unless some hope that we are winning.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
You know what?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
We're gonna actually win this time.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
But maybe this time we can actually finally get lucky, you know what I mean?

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
Maybe this time we could probably win in a volleyball tournament style match, you know what I mean?

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
But unfortunately that's probably not gonna happen.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
But we should still use our best and somehow win.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Alright, let's do this!

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
Alright, team, boy dog and Vidya.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
We have prepared for this only moment.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
So either way, we have to lock the in.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
Okay, gang, boy dog, you have to be on the defensive.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Vegeta, you'll be more on the offense.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
At me, I'll be on the all-rounder in the middle.

03:00.000 --> 03:07.000
Boy dog, you'll be on the back and Vegeta will be getting more on the front and I'll be in the middle, okay team?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Let's do this.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Alright, it's time for the volleyball tournament.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
We'll take this death beam ball.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Vegeta, quick!

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Do it!

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Vegeta, take this rest here.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Final!

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Spike!

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Oh, no!

03:23.000 --> 03:35.000
I'm not gonna lie, this was the most wildest beach episode ever, other than the other type of channels, you know what I mean?

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
But either way, this has been the most fun I've never ever had ever been.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
If you know what I mean.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
But like, either way, to be honest man, like I'm having too much of a free time.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Well, this marks the end of this random episode.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
I hope you all like it.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
See you soon!
